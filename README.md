# Deathmatch Weapon Menu Plugin

The **Deathmatch Weapon Menu Plugin** is a versatile and user-friendly plugin for Counter-Strike 2 that provides players with an interactive menu for selecting weapons in all modes including Deathmatch mode. The plugin introduces a streamlined menu system for rifles and pistols, offering both a visually clean interface and a logical command flow.

NOTE: I have developed this plugin as part of a list of other plugins for my CS2 server, this version will be updated later on so other plugin.

## Commands

1. **Rifle Selection**:
   - Use the `!weapons` or `!guns` command to open the Rifle Menu.

   - The Pistol Menu is opened automatically.

2. **Pistol Selection**:
   - Use the `!pistols` command to directly access the Pistol Menu, or continue from the Rifle Menu.
